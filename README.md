# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Detection

### Introduction:

This project aims to classify whether a patient has chronic kidney disease or not. We will develop three neural networks:
- Perceptron Neural Network 
- Back propagation Neural Network
- Momentum  Neural Network

We will use kidney disease dataset from Kaggle. It has **200 rows** with **20 features** like red blood cells, pedal edema, sugar, etc. 

### Results:

-	The perceptron algorithm will not be able to correctly classify all examples, with **200 time of iteration** and **Learning Rate 0.01** our perceptron got a **82.32%** test accuracy.
- The Back Propagation network with **500 time of iteration**, **Learning Rate 0.3** and **3 Hidden Layers** our algorithm got a **99.50%** test accuracy.
- The momentum algorithm with **50 time of iteration**, **Learning Rate 0.05** and **5 Hidden Layers** our algorithm got a **95.83%** test accuracy.
